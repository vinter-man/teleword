"""
SMALL TEST PART (simple)
1 testing for user
2 collecting information about today's date, errors, solutions on the first try
3 correct information writing ()

update the date during the test so that there is no such thing that it started at 23:59, finished tomorrow and it
incorrectly counted the system

if the user resets by start or cancel - the date must already be recorded

everything should, unlike writing new words, be written instantly and dynamically,

however, the set of words of ratings, etc. must be unchanged from the start of the test

first, the current list is compiled (completely ready) - then there are tests - and the system records everything
dynamically
